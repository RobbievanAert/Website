Three methods are currently included in the package. First, the p-uniform method (van Assen, van Aert, \u0026amp; Wicherts, 2015; van Aert, Wicherts, \u0026amp; van Assen, 2016) can be used for estimating effect size, testing the null hypothesis of no effect, and testing for publication bias in a meta-analysis. Another method in the package is the hybrid method (van Aert \u0026amp; van Assen, 2018). This method is a meta-analysis method for combining an original study and replication and while taking into account statistical significance of the original study. The p-uniform and hybrid method are based on the statistical theory that the distribution of p-values is uniform at the population effect size. The third method in the package is the Snapshot Bayesian Hybrid Meta-Analysis Method (van Aert \u0026amp; van Assen, 2017). This method computes posterior probabilities at four hypothesized effect sizes (e.g., no, small, medium, and large) based on an original study and replication while taking into account statistical significance in the original study. The method can also be used for computing the required sample size of the replication akin to power analysis in null hypothesis significance testing.\nInstalling the “puniform” package\rThe “puniform” package is available on CRAN, and it can be easily installed and loaded into R.

It is often suggested that psychological resilience plays an important role in the maintenance and/or enhancement of their mental health and functioning under these circumstances. Method A systematic literature search was conducted using PsycINFO, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Web of Science, and PubMed up to August of 2019 retrieving 3,698 reports. Schmidt and Hunter meta-analytical techniques were used to assess the predictive value of psychological resilience on ten different military relevant mental health and functioning outcomes. Multivariate meta-analysis assessed the origin of heterogeneity among bivariate effect sizes. Results The effect sizes of 40 eligible peer-reviewed papers covering 40 unique samples were included in the meta-analysis. Seventy-eight percent of these studies were published after 2010 and were predominantly conducted in western countries. Bivariate effect sizes were low to medium (absolute values: 0.08 to 0.36) and multivariate effect sizes, adjusting for across studies varying sets of covariates, were low to trivial (absolute values: 0.02 to 0.08). Moderator analyses using multivariate meta-analysis on 60 bivariate effect sizes, revealed no significant effect of type of psychological resilience scale, time-lag, and career stage. Conclusions The current review found no indications that different conceptualizations of psychological resilience across a variety of research designs, are strongly predictive of mental health and functioning among military personnel. Future directions (moderator/mediator models, stressor type specifications, and directionality) for prospective studies are discussed. Our results question the usefulness of interventions to enhance the resilience of soldiers to improve their mental health and functioning.","tags":["Meta-analysis","Military","Prospective","Psychological resilience","Review"],"title":"Longitudinal associations of psychological resilience with mental health and functioning among military personnel: A meta-analysis of prospective studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Havránek","T D Stanley","H Doucouliagos","P Bom","J Geyer-Klingeberg","I Iwasaki","W R Reed","K Rost","**R C M van Aert**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"9e478ca08505963b4dbbaff692ea768b","permalink":"/publication/havranek-2020/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T14:15:54.546531Z","relpermalink":"/publication/havranek-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Meta-analysis has become the conventional approach to synthesizing the results of empirical economics research.

This method has previously been justified by taking all estimated variances as known and using a different pivotal quantity to the more conventional one when making inferences about the average effect. We provide a new conceptual framework for, and justification of, the Hartung-Knapp method. Specifically, we show that inferences from fitted random-effects models, using both the conventional and the Hartung-Knapp method, are equivalent to those from closely related intercept only weighted least squares regression models. This observation provides a new link between Hartung and Knapp's methodology for meta-analysis and standard linear models, where it can be seen that the Hartung-Knapp method can be justified by a linear model that makes a slightly weaker assumption than taking all variances as known. This provides intuition for why the Hartung-Knapp method has been found to perform better than the conventional one in simulation studies. Furthermore, our new findings give more credence to ad hoc adjustments of confidence intervals from the Hartung-Knapp method that ensure these are at least as wide as more conventional confidence intervals. The conceptual basis for the Hartung-Knapp method that we present here should replace the established one because it more clearly illustrates the potential benefit of using it.","tags":null,"title":"A new justification of the Hartung-Knapp method for random-effects meta-analysis based on weighted least squares regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**R C M van Aert**","J M Wicherts","M A L M van Assen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"8d262eb2689b029ac501ca1c7c84123a","permalink":"/publication/van-aert-2019-d/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T12:13:57.464267Z","relpermalink":"/publication/van-aert-2019-d/","section":"publication","summary":"Publication bias is a substantial problem for the credibility of research in general and of meta-analyses in particular, as it yields overestimated effects and may suggest the existence of non-existing effects. Although there is consensus that publication bias exists, how strongly it affects different scientific literatures is currently less well-known. We examined evidence of publication bias in a large-scale data set of primary studies that were included in 83 meta-analyses published in Psychological Bulletin (representing meta-analyses from psychology) and 499 systematic reviews from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR; representing meta-analyses from medicine). Publication bias was assessed on all homogeneous subsets (3.8% of all subsets of meta-analyses published in Psychological Bulletin) of primary studies included in meta-analyses, because publication bias methods do not have good statistical properties if the true effect size is heterogeneous. Publication bias tests did not reveal evidence for bias in the homogeneous subsets. Overestimation was minimal but statistically significant, providing evidence of publication bias that appeared to be similar in both fields. However, a Monte-Carlo simulation study revealed that the creation of homogeneous subsets resulted in challenging conditions for publication bias methods since the number of effect sizes in a subset was rather small (median number of effect sizes equaled 6). Our findings are in line with, in its most extreme case, publication bias ranging from no bias until only 5% statistically nonsignificant effect sizes being published. These and other findings, in combination with the small percentages of statistically significant primary effect sizes (28.9% and 18.9% for subsets published in Psychological Bulletin and CDSR), led to the conclusion that evidence for publication bias in the studied homogeneous subsets is weak, but suggestive of mild publication bias in both psychology and medicine.","tags":null,"title":"Publication bias examined in meta-analyses from psychology and medicine: A meta-meta-analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**R C M van Aert**","M A L M van Assen","W Viechtbauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d83ffde5917b77bee5e9d95f6a284b1b","permalink":"/publication/van-aert-2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T12:13:57.457285Z","relpermalink":"/publication/van-aert-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The effect sizes of studies included in a meta-analysis do often not share a common true effect size due to differences in for instance the design of the studies. Estimates of this so-called between-study variance are usually imprecise. Hence, reporting a confidence interval together with a point estimate of the amount of between-study variance facilitates interpretation of the meta-analytic results. Two methods that are recommended to be used for creating such a confidence interval are the Q-profile and generalized Q-statistic method that both make use of the Q-statistic. These methods are exact if the assumptions underlying the random-effects model hold, but these assumptions are usually violated in practice such that confidence intervals of the methods are approximate rather than exact confidence intervals. We illustrate by means of two Monte-Carlo simulation studies with odds ratio as effect size measure that coverage probabilities of both methods can be substantially below the nominal coverage rate in situations that are representative for meta-analyses in practice. We also show that these too low coverage probabilities are caused by violations of the assumptions of the random-effects model (ie, normal sampling distributions of the effect size measure and known sampling variances) and are especially prevalent if the sample sizes in the primary studies are small.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical properties of methods based on the Q-statistic for constructing a confidence interval for the between-study variance in meta-analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H E M Augusteijn","**R C M van Aert**","M A L M van Assen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b8d4ee87e7cc9a7c646d09b00ec8bc2c","permalink":"/publication/augusteijn-2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T12:13:57.450516Z","relpermalink":"/publication/augusteijn-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"One of the main goals of meta-analysis is to test for and estimate the heterogeneity of effect sizes. We examined the effect of publication bias on the Q test and assessments of heterogeneity as a function of true heterogeneity, publication bias, true effect size, number of studies, and variation of sample sizes. The present study has two main contributions and is relevant to all researchers conducting meta-analysis. First, we show when and how publication bias affects the assessment of heterogeneity. The expected values of heterogeneity measures H² and I² were analytically derived, and the power and Type I error rate of the Q test were examined in a Monte Carlo simulation study. Our results show that the effect of publication bias on the Q test and assessment of heterogeneity is large, complex, and nonlinear. Publication bias can both dramatically decrease and increase heterogeneity in true effect size, particularly if the number of studies is large and population effect size is small. We therefore conclude that the Q test of homogeneity and heterogeneity measures H² and I² are generally not valid when publication bias is present. Our second contribution is that we introduce a web application, Q-sense, which can be used to determine the impact of publication bias on the assessment of heterogeneity within a certain meta-analysis and to assess the robustness of the meta-analytic estimate to publication bias. Furthermore, we apply Q-sense to 2 published meta-analyses, showing how publication bias can result in invalid estimates of effect size and heterogeneity.

However, researchers who conduct a replication and want to statistically combine the results of their replication with a statistically significant original study encounter problems when using traditional meta-analysis techniques. The original study's effect size is most probably overestimated because it is statistically significant, and this bias is not taken into consideration in traditional meta-analysis. We have developed a hybrid method that does take the statistical significance of an original study into account and enables (a) accurate effect size estimation, (b) estimation of a confidence interval, and (c) testing of the null hypothesis of no effect. We analytically approximate the performance of the hybrid method and describe its statistical properties. By applying the hybrid method to data from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (Open Science Collaboration, 2015), we demonstrate that the conclusions based on the hybrid method are often in line with those of the replication, suggesting that many published psychological studies have smaller effect sizes than those reported in the original study, and that some effects may even be absent. We offer hands-on guidelines for how to statistically combine an original study and replication, and have developed a Web-based application ( https://rvanaert.shinyapps.io/hybrid ) for applying the hybrid method.","tags":["van Aert2017"],"title":"Examining reproducibility in psychology: A hybrid method for combining a statistically significant original study and a replication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R A Klein","...","**R C M van Aert**","...","B A Nosek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"3c2f64057052417793c4711a1283e6b6","permalink":"/publication/klein-2018/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T12:13:57.469253Z","relpermalink":"/publication/klein-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Many Labs 2: Investigating variation in replicability across samples and settings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**R C M van Aert**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4f43108d4a3b71de44f931438b7eb9d1","permalink":"/publication/van-aert-2018/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T12:13:57.460277Z","relpermalink":"/publication/van-aert-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Meta-analysis: Shortcomings and potential","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**R C M van Aert**","D Jackson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"c0419e1f7368a40cc1d229e24dd7b398","permalink":"/publication/van-aert-2018-a/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T12:13:57.452299Z","relpermalink":"/publication/van-aert-2018-a/","section":"publication","summary":"A wide variety of estimators of the between-study variance are available in random-effects meta-analysis. Many, but not all, of these estimators are based on the method of moments. The DerSimonian-Laird estimator is widely used in applications, but the Paule-Mandel estimator is an alternative that is now recommended. Recently, DerSimonian and Kacker have developed two-step moment-based estimators of the between-study variance. We extend these two-step estimators so that multiple (more than two) steps are used. We establish the surprising result that the multistep estimator tends towards the Paule-Mandel estimator as the number of steps becomes large. Hence, the iterative scheme underlying our new multistep estimator provides a hitherto unknown relationship between two-step estimators and Paule-Mandel estimator. Our analysis suggests that two-step estimators are not necessarily distinct estimators in their own right; instead, they are quantities that are closely related to the usual iterative scheme that is used to calculate the Paule-Mandel estimate. The relationship that we establish between the multistep and Paule-Mandel estimator is another justification for the use of the latter estimator. Two-step and multistep estimators are perhaps best conceptualized as approximate Paule-Mandel estimators.","tags":null,"title":"Multistep estimators of the between-study variance: The relationship with the Paule-Mandel estimator","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1505260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1505260800,"objectID":"d606a18c23a49f9d16e9bd1a511b23c6","permalink":"/talk/bitss_london/","publishdate":"2017-09-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/bitss_london/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Meta-analysis and publication bias","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"584116d2f9e0e5f2d3d8fd5acbc4d822","permalink":"/talk/ico_utrecht/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ico_utrecht/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The consequences of publication bias and questionable research practices","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1499904000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499904000,"objectID":"9258e246d8722bbfb025a3872f75001a","permalink":"/talk/imps_zurich/","publishdate":"2017-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/imps_zurich/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Estimating replicability of science by taking statistical significance into account","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498262400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498262400,"objectID":"875900443633a30b0c8bec2d284b2cb5","permalink":"/talk/scientific_error_tilburg/","publishdate":"2017-06-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/scientific_error_tilburg/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Estimating the replicability of science by taking statistical significance into account","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1497398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497398400,"objectID":"4c9374cdd2e30f38c8b601f925c5ad79","permalink":"/talk/iops_leuven/","publishdate":"2017-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/iops_leuven/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Estimating replicability of science by taking statistical significance into account","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1486684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1486684800,"objectID":"52df5d0776af791b5da8df68fc79f1b8","permalink":"/talk/mrc_cambridge/","publishdate":"2017-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mrc_cambridge/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Correcting for publication bias in a meta-analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**R C M van Aert**","M A L M van Assen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"63c016f647fa3ef03d8625990402270a","permalink":"/publication/van-aert-2017/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T12:13:57.472266Z","relpermalink":"/publication/van-aert-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The vast majority of published results in the literature is statistically significant, which raises concerns about their reliability. The Reproducibility Project Psychology (RPP) and Experimental Economics Replication Project (EE-RP) both replicated a large number of published studies in psychology and economics. The original study and replication were statistically significant in 36.1% in RPP and 68.8% in EE-RP suggesting many null effects among the replicated studies. However, evidence in favor of the null hypothesis cannot be examined with null hypothesis significance testing. We developed a Bayesian meta-analysis method called snapshot hybrid that is easy to use and understand and quantifies the amount of evidence in favor of a zero, small, medium and large effect. The method computes posterior model probabilities for a zero, small, medium, and large effect and adjusts for publication bias by taking into account that the original study is statistically significant. We first analytically approximate the methods performance, and demonstrate the necessity to control for the original study's significance to enable the accumulation of evidence for a true zero effect. Then we applied the method to the data of RPP and EE-RP, showing that the underlying effect sizes of the included studies in EE-RP are generally larger than in RPP, but that the sample sizes of especially the included studies in RPP are often too small to draw definite conclusions about the true effect size. We also illustrate how snapshot hybrid can be used to determine the required sample size of the replication akin to power analysis in null hypothesis significance testing and present an easy to use web application (https://rvanaert.shinyapps.io/snapshot/) and R code for applying the method.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian evaluation of effect size after replicating an original study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1481587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481587200,"objectID":"caf37d60a84f41f60ed03d7b33b45a9f","permalink":"/talk/bitss_berkeley/","publishdate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/bitss_berkeley/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Getting it right with meta-analysis: Correcting effect size for publication bias in meta-analyses from psychology and medicine","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"48798a96ae8153784f9c961d1c5fdcdf","permalink":"/talk/colloquium_erasmus/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/colloquium_erasmus/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Estimating the replicability of science: Accounting for statistical significance of the original study","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1474070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1474070400,"objectID":"cb92a14d65f9308b3e27a474cbe60cd4","permalink":"/talk/maer-net_conway/","publishdate":"2016-09-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/maer-net_conway/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Conducting meta-analyses based on p-values: Reservations and recommendations for applying p-uniform and p-curve","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1464472800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464472800,"objectID":"4dbd5531318423d6914f74b8a015847e","permalink":"/talk/aps_chicago/","publishdate":"2016-05-29T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/aps_chicago/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Conducting meta-analyses based on p-values: Reservations and recommendations for applying p-uniform and p-curve","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The methodology on which the p-uniform and p-curve methods are based has great promise for providing accurate meta-analytic estimates in the presence of publication bias. However, in this article, we show that in some situations, p-curve behaves erratically, whereas p-uniform may yield implausible estimates of negative effect size. Moreover, we show that (and explain why) p-curve and p-uniform result in overestimation of effect size under moderate-to-large heterogeneity and may yield unpredictable bias when researchers employ p-hacking. We offer hands-on recommendations on applying and interpreting results of meta-analyses in general and p-uniform and p-curve in particular. Both methods as well as traditional methods are applied to a meta-analysis on the effect of weight on judgments of importance. We offer guidance for applying p-uniform or p-curve using R and a user-friendly web application for applying p-uniform.","tags":null,"title":"Conducting meta-analyses on p-values: Reservations and recommendations for applying p-uniform and p-curve","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J M Wicherts","C L S Veldkamp","H E M Augusteijn","M Bakker","**R C M van Aert**","M A L M van Assen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"5447d9e169d286efc4753cde70af9c5c","permalink":"/publication/wicherts-2016/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T12:13:57.474242Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wicherts-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The designing, collecting, analyzing, and reporting of psychological studies entail many choices that are often arbitrary.

In a Monte-Carlo study, we investigated the coverage and computation time of the Goodman?Kruskal CI, the Cliff-consistent CI, the profile likelihood CI, and the score CI for Goodman and Kruskal's gamma, under several conditions. The choice for Goodman and Kruskal's gamma was based on results of Woods [Consistent small-sample variances for six gamma-family measures of ordinal association. Multivar Behav Res. 2009;44:525?551], who found relatively poor coverage for gamma for very small samples compared to other ordinal association measures. The profile likelihood CI and the score CI had the best coverage, close to the nominal value, but those CIs could often not be computed for sparse tables. The coverage of the Goodman?Kruskal CI and the Cliff-consistent CI was often poor. Computation time was fast to reasonably fast for all types of CI.","tags":null,"title":"Comparing confidence intervals for Goodman and Kruskal's gamma coefficient","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C H J Hartgerink","**R C M van Aert**","M B Nuijten","J M Wicherts","M A L M van Assen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"a3a47df7ed605a19641f5479598f052b","permalink":"/publication/hartgerink-2015/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T12:13:57.446314Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hartgerink-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Distributions of p-values smaller than .05 in psychology: What is going on?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Open Science Collaboration"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"6f39d10d307fda0681e29776741faac0","permalink":"/publication/open-science-collaboration-2015/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T14:01:35.275899Z","relpermalink":"/publication/open-science-collaboration-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.","tags":null,"title":"Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M A L M van Assen","**R C M van Aert**","J M Wicherts"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"e81642b63ec003d6f9d3ce3004620480","permalink":"/publication/van-assen-2015/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T12:13:57.466261Z","relpermalink":"/publication/van-assen-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Publication bias threatens the validity of meta-analytic results and leads to overestimation of the effect size in traditional meta-analysis. This particularly applies to meta-analyses that feature small studies, which are ubiquitous in psychology. Here we develop a new method for meta-analysis that deals with publication bias. This method, p-uniform, enables (a) testing of publication bias, (b) effect size estimation, and (c) testing of the null-hypothesis of no effect. No current method for meta-analysis possesses all 3 qualities. Application of p-uniform is straightforward because no additional data on missing studies are needed and no sophisticated assumptions or choices need to be made before applying it. Simulations show that p-uniform generally outperforms the trim-and-fill method and the test of excess significance (TES; Ioannidis \u0026 Trikalinos, 2007b) if publication bias exists and population effect size is homogenous or heterogeneity is slight. For illustration, p-uniform and other publication bias analyses are applied to the meta-analysis of McCall and Carriger (1993) examining the association between infants' habituation to a stimulus and their later cognitive ability (IQ). We conclude that p-uniform is a valuable technique for examining publication bias and estimating population effects in fixed-effect meta-analyses, and as sensitivity analysis to draw inferences about publication bias.","tags":null,"title":"Meta-analysis using effect size distributions of only statistically significant studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1410652800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1410652800,"objectID":"0c042a38fb6a208415a267c3a7d5f205","permalink":"/talk/human_factors_amsterdam/","publishdate":"2014-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/human_factors_amsterdam/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Unbiased effect estimation in the presence of publication bias","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1406160000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1406160000,"objectID":"7d64c794d8457adb493d6e1a8560e002","permalink":"/talk/eam_utrecht/","publishdate":"2014-07-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/eam_utrecht/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Unbiased effect estimation in the presence of publication bias: A new method for meta-analysis and assessing publication bias","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1400889600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1400889600,"objectID":"62a2fdfd49354009526507a11df4b139","permalink":"/talk/aps_san_francisco/","publishdate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/aps_san_francisco/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of replication","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1392595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1392595200,"objectID":"57f3acd9276c18268df121252a1a47b8","permalink":"/talk/colloquium_tilburg_2014/","publishdate":"2014-02-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/colloquium_tilburg_2014/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Unbiased effect estimation in the presence of publication bias: A new method for meta-analysis and assessing publication bias","type":"talk"},{"authors":["M B Nuijten","M A L M van Assen","**R C M van Aert**","J M Wicherts"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"cdeac4ead2896d8a94db02cd2e7e9c43","permalink":"/publication/nuijten-2014/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T12:13:57.454309Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nuijten-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Standard analyses fail to show that US studies overestimate effect sizes in softer research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M A L M van Assen","**R C M van Aert**","M B Nuijten","J M Wicherts"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"3586dc304da2357180df23ccbe19828f","permalink":"/publication/van-assen-2014/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T12:13:57.448309Z","relpermalink":"/publication/van-assen-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: De Winter and Happee examined whether science based on selective publishing of significant results may be effective in accurate estimation of population effects, and whether this is even more effective than a science in which all results are published (i.e., a science without publication bias). Based on their simulation study they concluded that \"selective publishing yields a more accurate meta-analytic estimation of the true effect than publishing everything, (and that) publishing nonreplicable results while placing null results in the file drawer can be beneficial for the scientific collective\" (p.4). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using their scenario with a small to medium population effect size, we show that publishing everything is more effective for the scientific collective than selective publishing of significant results. Additionally, we examined a scenario with a null effect, which provides a more dramatic illustration of the superiority of publishing everything over selective publishing. CONCLUSION: Publishing everything is more effective than only reporting significant outcomes.","tags":null,"title":"Why publishing everything is more effective than selective publishing of statistically significant results","type":"publication"}]
