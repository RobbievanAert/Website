Welcome to my website! I am working at the department of Methodology and Statistics at Tilburg University and I am member of the [Meta-Research Center](https://metaresearch.nl/)

My research interests are statistical methods to conduct meta-analyses and methods to correct for publication bias. I am also a [BITSS Catalyst](https://www.bitss.org/catalysts/) advocating research transparency
