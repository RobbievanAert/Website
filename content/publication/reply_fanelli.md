abstract = "Fanelli and Ioannidis (1) analyzed 82 meta-analyses and found more extreme effect sizes in studies from the United States (US), and when using soft behavioral versus less soft biobehavioral and nonbehavioral methods. Here we present a reanalysis of their data based on standard meta-meta-regressions. Results show overall publication bias across methods, but fail to corroborate Fanelli and Ioannidisâ€™ conclusions that effects from behavioral research and the US are more inflated and more strongly subject to publication bias."
