# Welcome to my website

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the department of Methodology and Statistics at Tilburg University and member of the [Meta-Research Center](http://metaresearch.nl/). My research interests are statistical methods to conduct meta-analyses and methods to correct for publication bias. I am also a [BITSS Catalyst](https://www.bitss.org/catalysts/) advocating research transparency.
